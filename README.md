# FlowProgramData
A program in C++ to help them to study the variation of annual water flow in a river of their interest.  
This was a lab exercise done in my second year programming class ENSF 337 Programming Fundamentals where we have learnt C and C++. 
This exercise uses reading from a file and removing data points or adding them from the file provided flow. 
This program is very simple to run in VScode and can be done by downloading/cloning this repository and then compiling the hydro.cpp file.
